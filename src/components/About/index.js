                    Full-stack Web Developer who recently earned a certificate in Web Development from The University of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp, with newly developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React.js, and responsive web design. I am ambitious in facing problems head-on and learning new technologies, focusing on mobile-first design and development. For example, I worked on a team of six to develop a single-page MERN application that helps users shop for apparel and checkout through the Stripe payment platform. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skill set to become a skilled Software Engineer. Bringing value to user-centric products by implementing best practices and collaborating in a diverse environment.
